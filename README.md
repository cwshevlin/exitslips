# ExitSlips

Tagline for exit slips

## Purpose

ExitSlips provides teachers with a simple way to collect data and act on it. Teachers add a class and students to that class, then create a quiz for that class. Students take the quiz and the results are immediately available for the teacher to view. ExitSlips also sorts students into groups based on the results of the quiz so the teacher can use them in the next day's instruction.
